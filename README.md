# Purpose

An app that generates 9-digit lottery numbers.

# Demo

Press "question mark" button and 9-digit random number will appear.

#Notes:

Icon classes cannot be directly combined with other components. They should not be used along with other classes on the same element. Instead, add a nested <span> and apply the icon classes to the <span>.
